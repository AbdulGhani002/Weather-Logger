## Description of the Project Architecture

The project architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for efficient data retrieval, processing, and visualization. The main components of the architecture are:

1. **Backend: NASA API Integration**
   - Custom HTTP client to query NASA APIs using C++.
   - Methods to handle large data sets without memory overflow.
   - Caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API requests.
   - Multi-threaded data retrieval for improved performance.
   - Error handling for API failure, data corruption, or rate limits.

2. **Data Storage and Management**
   - Custom database engine in C++ to store and retrieve weather data efficiently.
   - Compression algorithms to reduce storage footprint.
   - Query engine for historical weather data analysis.
   - Algorithms for data interpolation, smoothing, and cleaning.

3. **Image Analysis**
   - Image loading, processing, and conversion algorithms.
   - Custom filters (edge detection, noise reduction, etc.).
   - Algorithm for satellite image analysis (e.g., cloud cover detection, storm path prediction).
   - Machine learning algorithms for weather pattern recognition (training done offline).
   - Image compression and optimization module.

4. **Weather Forecasting Algorithms**
   - Custom algorithms to calculate forecasts from raw data.
   - Time series analysis for historical data to improve forecast accuracy.
   - Machine learning (custom, non-library implementation) to predict extreme weather events.
   - Climate change simulation module using statistical models.

5. **Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms**
   - Custom tree structures, hash maps, and graph algorithms to store and retrieve data.
   - Algorithms for efficient spatial data handling (geospatial indexing).
   - Data sorting algorithms to process and visualize large weather datasets.
   - Custom algorithms for real-time data processing.

6. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Custom GUI rendering engine in C++ (handle windows, buttons, dropdowns, etc.).
   - Interactive weather charts, graphs, and maps.
   - Modular dashboard with customizable widgets (e.g., current weather, radar maps, satellite imagery).
   - Real-time data update on the GUI without freezing the interface (multi-threading).
   - Integration of image analysis results into the GUI (e.g., highlight storm areas on maps).

7. **User Interactions and Data Visualization**
   - Custom plotting algorithms (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs).
   - Map-based data visualization tool.
   - Weather alert system with pop-ups and notifications.
   - Interactive timeline for historical weather data.

8. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for every module using custom test suites (no libraries).
   - Mock objects for NASA API to test integration without hitting the live service.
   - Edge case tests for data processing algorithms (e.g., handling corrupted data).
   - Integration tests for the interaction between GUI, backend, and API modules.
   - Performance and response time tests under load (simulating large-scale data inputs).
   - Full system tests with actual NASA data (ensure accurate weather forecasts).
   - GUI responsiveness tests under real-time updates and image analysis tasks.
   - Acceptance tests against real-world user scenarios (forecast checking, weather alerts, etc.).

9. **Code and Documentation**
   - Developer documentation for each module (API interaction, data processing, GUI, etc.).
   - User manuals with detailed instructions on app features.
   - Project technical paper summarizing architecture, design choices, and algorithms.
   - Glossary of terms and acronyms for weather and technical concepts.

10. **Deployment & Maintenance**
    - Deployment plan for the app (target platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux).
    - Custom installer and updater system.
    - Telemetry and logging to gather usage data.
    - Helpdesk and bug-tracking system.
