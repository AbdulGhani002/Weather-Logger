# Coding Standards and Naming Conventions

## General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for functions and classes.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.
- Avoid magic numbers; use constants or enums instead.
- Write comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.
- Ensure code is properly formatted and indented.

## Naming Conventions

### Variables
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.
- Prefix boolean variables with "is" or "has" (e.g., isReady, hasData).

### Functions
- Use camelCase for function names.
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the function.
- Start function names with a verb (e.g., calculateWeather, fetchData).

### Classes
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use nouns or noun phrases that describe the purpose of the class (e.g., WeatherData, ApiClient).

### Constants
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constant names.
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the constant (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, API_ENDPOINT).

### Files
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names.
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the file (e.g., weather_data.cpp, api_client.h).

## Code Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement (e.g., if, for, while).
- Place closing braces on a new line.
- Use spaces around operators (e.g., =, +, -, *, /).
- Use spaces after commas in function arguments and array elements.

## Commenting
- Use single-line comments (//) for brief explanations.
- Use multi-line comments (/* */) for detailed explanations or documentation.
- Write comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks, not to restate the code.
- Use TODO comments to indicate areas that need further work or improvement.

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions for error handling.
- Provide meaningful error messages that help diagnose the issue.
- Ensure resources are properly released in case of an error (e.g., close files, release memory).

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions and classes.
- Use descriptive names for test cases that convey the purpose of the test.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and potential error conditions.
- Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules.
- Use mock objects to simulate external dependencies (e.g., NASA API).

## Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Follow a consistent commit message format (e.g., "Add feature X", "Fix bug Y").
- Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Merge branches into the main branch only after thorough testing and code review.

## Code Review
- Conduct code reviews for all changes before merging into the main branch.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- Ensure code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Verify that tests pass and code coverage is adequate.
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities and performance issues.

## Documentation
- Write clear and concise documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.
- Use docstrings or comments to describe the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation as the code evolves.
- Provide examples and usage instructions where applicable.
