## API Interaction

### NASA API Client

The NASA API client is responsible for querying NASA APIs and handling the responses. It includes the following features:
- Custom HTTP client to query NASA APIs using C++.
- Methods to handle large data sets without memory overflow.
- Caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API requests.
- Multi-threaded data retrieval for improved performance.
- Error handling for API failure, data corruption, or rate limits.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "nasa_api_client.h"

int main() {
    NASAApiClient client("your_api_key");
    std::string data = client.queryAPI("planetary/apod");
    std::cout << data << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Data Processing

### Custom Database Engine

The custom database engine is designed to store and retrieve weather data efficiently. It includes the following features:
- Compression algorithms to reduce storage footprint.
- Query engine for historical weather data analysis.
- Algorithms for data interpolation, smoothing, and cleaning.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "database_engine.h"

int main() {
    DatabaseEngine db;
    db.insertWeatherData("2021-01-01", "sunny");
    std::string weather = db.queryWeatherData("2021-01-01");
    std::cout << weather << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Image Analysis

### Image Processing

The image processing module handles image loading, processing, and conversion. It includes the following features:
- Custom filters (edge detection, noise reduction, etc.).
- Algorithm for satellite image analysis (e.g., cloud cover detection, storm path prediction).
- Machine learning algorithms for weather pattern recognition (training done offline).
- Image compression and optimization module.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "image_processing.h"

int main() {
    ImageProcessor processor;
    processor.loadImage("satellite_image.png");
    processor.applyFilter("edge_detection");
    processor.saveImage("processed_image.png");
    return 0;
}
```

## Weather Forecasting

### Forecasting Algorithms

The forecasting algorithms module is responsible for calculating weather forecasts from raw data. It includes the following features:
- Custom algorithms to calculate forecasts from raw data.
- Time series analysis for historical data to improve forecast accuracy.
- Machine learning (custom, non-library implementation) to predict extreme weather events.
- Climate change simulation module using statistical models.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "forecasting_algorithms.h"

int main() {
    ForecastingEngine engine;
    engine.loadHistoricalData("historical_weather_data.csv");
    std::string forecast = engine.calculateForecast("2021-01-01");
    std::cout << forecast << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

### GUI Rendering Engine

The GUI rendering engine is responsible for creating and managing the graphical user interface. It includes the following features:
- Custom GUI rendering engine in C++ (handle windows, buttons, dropdowns, etc.).
- Interactive weather charts, graphs, and maps.
- Modular dashboard with customizable widgets (e.g., current weather, radar maps, satellite imagery).
- Real-time data update on the GUI without freezing the interface (multi-threading).
- Integration of image analysis results into the GUI (e.g., highlight storm areas on maps).

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "gui_rendering_engine.h"

int main() {
    GUIRenderingEngine gui;
    gui.createWindow("Weather Dashboard", 800, 600);
    gui.createButton("Weather Dashboard", "Refresh", []() {
        std::cout << "Refreshing data..." << std::endl;
    });
    gui.updateGUI();
    return 0;
}
```

## User Interactions and Data Visualization

### Data Visualization

The data visualization module is responsible for creating custom plots and visualizations. It includes the following features:
- Custom plotting algorithms (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs).
- Map-based data visualization tool.
- Weather alert system with pop-ups and notifications.
- Interactive timeline for historical weather data.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "data_visualization.h"

int main() {
    DataVisualizer visualizer;
    visualizer.createBarChart("Temperature Data", {30, 25, 28, 32, 31});
    visualizer.createMapVisualization("Weather Map", {{0, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0}});
    visualizer.showVisualization();
    return 0;
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are written for every module using custom test suites (no libraries). The unit tests include:
- Mock objects for NASA API to test integration without hitting the live service.
- Edge case tests for data processing algorithms (e.g., handling corrupted data).

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "unit_tests.h"

int main() {
    runUnitTests();
    return 0;
}
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests are written to verify the interaction between different modules. The integration tests include:
- Tests for the interaction between GUI, backend, and API modules.
- Performance and response time tests under load (simulating large-scale data inputs).

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "integration_tests.h"

int main() {
    runIntegrationTests();
    return 0;
}
```

### System Testing

System tests are conducted with actual NASA data to ensure accurate weather forecasts. The system tests include:
- Full system tests with actual NASA data.
- GUI responsiveness tests under real-time updates and image analysis tasks.

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "system_tests.h"

int main() {
    runSystemTests();
    return 0;
}
```

### Acceptance Testing

Acceptance tests are conducted against real-world user scenarios to ensure compliance with project goals. The acceptance tests include:
- Tests against real-world user scenarios (forecast checking, weather alerts, etc.).
- Ensuring compliance with project goals (accuracy, performance, usability).

#### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "acceptance_tests.h"

int main() {
    runAcceptanceTests();
    return 0;
}
```

## Using the install.sh Script

To simplify the setup process, you can use the `install.sh` script. This script will run all tests, install necessary dependencies, build the project, and run the application. To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
