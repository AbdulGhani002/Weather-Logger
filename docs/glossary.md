# Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

## Weather Concepts

- **API**: Application Programming Interface, a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
- **Cloud Cover**: The fraction of the sky covered by clouds.
- **Data Interpolation**: A method of estimating unknown values that fall between known values.
- **Edge Detection**: A technique used in image processing to identify the boundaries of objects within an image.
- **Geospatial Indexing**: A method of storing and querying data that represents objects defined in a geometric space.
- **Machine Learning**: A type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.
- **Multi-threading**: A technique that allows multiple threads to be executed concurrently, improving the performance of applications.
- **NASA**: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.
- **Noise Reduction**: A process used in image processing to remove unwanted noise from an image.
- **Query Engine**: A system that allows users to search and retrieve data from a database.
- **Rate Limits**: Restrictions on the number of API requests that can be made within a certain time period.
- **Smoothing**: A technique used in data processing to remove noise and make the data more interpretable.
- **Time Series Analysis**: A method of analyzing time-ordered data points to extract meaningful statistics and identify patterns.
- **Weather Forecasting**: The process of predicting future weather conditions based on the analysis of meteorological data.

## Technical Concepts

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, a set of practices that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.
- **Compression Algorithms**: Techniques used to reduce the size of data for storage or transmission.
- **Custom HTTP Client**: A client specifically designed to send HTTP requests and receive responses from a server.
- **Data Structures**: Ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: The process of responding to and managing errors that occur during the execution of a program.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface, a visual way of interacting with a computer using items such as windows, icons, and menus.
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Tools that analyze code for potential errors and vulnerabilities without executing the program.
- **Telemetry**: The process of recording and transmitting the readings of an instrument.
- **Unit Testing**: A type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
